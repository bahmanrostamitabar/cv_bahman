# Research

  * I have authored `r NROW(pubs)` papers, chapters or books on forecasting, analytics and supply chain topics (listed in the following sections ).
  * My research interests includes forecasting, predictive modeling, business analytics, statistical and machine learning, and their links to policy, decision making and planning.  
  * My current research involves forecasting and analysis of large collections of data in various areas including  vaccine distribution, supply chains of medical items, supply chain of contraceptive products, patient flow in emergency departements, trauma network and ambulance services and demand of inpatiend and community mental health services.
  * I have been working with various national and international organisations including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), National Health Service (NHS) UK, Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST), John Snow, Inc (JSI) and DSV: Global Transport and Logistics.
  * I currently supervise five PhD students. I have previously supervised an additional 15 Master students with industry projects.
